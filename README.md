This code represents the Daelylas Gold Swing trading strategy developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is a swing trading strategy designed to trade gold (XAUUSD) and the Australian dollar against the US dollar (AUDUSD) in the MetaTrader 5 platform.

### Global Variables
- MinProfit: Minimum profit required for a swing condition to be met
- TimeFrame: Testing timeframe for the strategy

### Swing Conditions Determination
The function `IsSwingCondition()` is responsible for determining the swing conditions. The actual swing condition logic needs to be added to this function. Currently, a placeholder condition is used, which always returns true.

### Trade Functions
- `PlaceOrder(string symbol, ENUM_ORDER_TYPE orderType, double volume, double stopLoss, double takeProfit)`: Places a new order with the specified parameters.
- `ModifyOrder(int ticket, double stopLoss, double takeProfit)`: Modifies an existing order with the specified parameters.
- `CancelOrder(int ticket)`: Cancels an existing order with the specified ticket number.
- `RiskManagement()`: Implements risk management logic for the strategy.
- `TrailingStop()`: Implements trailing stop logic for the strategy.

### Main Program
The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point of the code. It checks if the swing conditions are met and places orders accordingly. In the current implementation, if the swing conditions are met, a buy order is placed for 0.1 volume on XAUUSD with a stop loss of 100 pips and a take profit of 200 pips. Additionally, a sell order is placed for 0.1 volume on AUDUSD with a stop loss of 200 pips and a take profit of 100 pips.

After placing the orders, the `RiskManagement()` and `TrailingStop()` functions are called to manage the risk and implement trailing stop logic.

### Testing Results
The `GetTestingResults()` function is responsible for retrieving and processing the testing results of the strategy. The actual implementation of this function is not provided in the code and needs to be added separately.

### Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the code. Currently, it calls the `GetTestingResults()` function to retrieve the testing results. If the initialization is successful, it returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED`.

### Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit(const int reason)` function is called during the deinitialization of the code. The actual deinitialization logic needs to be added to this function.
